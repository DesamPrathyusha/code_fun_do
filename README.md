we would like to develop a website or an application which uses weather data and supply chain information to alert pharmacies to increase supplies of medicine,bottled water and other items based on predicted weather-related disruption.
And we can also predict when and where the disaster will be most severe ,so emergency crews can be dispatched ahead of time in proper numbers to treat those in need.
We can do this by obtaining the current weather details and comparing with the data mined from the historical data or by collaborating with the weather informing agencies.
